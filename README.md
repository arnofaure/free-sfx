Why I created this package?
---
I'm not a sound designer (and don't pretend to be), but as a video editor (for 15+ years) I work with sound every single day. I created this sound package because I needed to play with sound to learn and experiment audio in a web environment. As I didn't find any totally free sfx without complicated license, I decided to create this one and share it.

It's still work in progress, and again more for training / experimenting (than real production, but of course you can use it as you like). I hope it could be helpful.

Content
---
The sound are available in AIFF, MP3 and OGG files. They are organized in folders, as follow:

- Alert
- Input
- Music
- SciFi
- Voice
- Woosh

I will try to keep updating this library with new sounds every once in a while.
